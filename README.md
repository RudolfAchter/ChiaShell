# A PowerShell CommandLine for Chia - ChiaShell

This is my attemnpt to automate Chia things with Powershell. I discovered the chia RPC API and i am astouned how easy it is for me to play around with it. Maybe it's also interesting for other chia people out there. So i'd like to share this as open source.
